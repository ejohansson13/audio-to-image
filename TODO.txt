TO-DO

1. Add NLP classifier for image prompts for more descriptive language and better performing image generation

2. Play around with other audio transcription models to see if similar or better performance to Whisper can be found with less memory consumption

3. Change text processing to Perl: gives opportunity to learn Perl and may offer faster performance with removing parentheses from audio transcription
